t3sketch
========

* A system for prototyping and building TADS 3 projects. *

t3sketch is a Python module that comes with a handful of scripts for
generating TADS 3 boilerplate that implement Rooms with Doors and Windows. It
also features a handy wrapper around the TADS 3 build system which can
automatically generate reasonable t3m makefiles. Lastly, it features the
ability to generate entire regions of connected floorplans from XML flowcharts
created at http://draw.io/
